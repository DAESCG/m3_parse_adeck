Meeting Motivation
------------------
Many large and complex datasets in the atmospheric and climate sciences are
stored and distributed in file types that aren't suited for such data. The
[A-DECK](www.ral.ucar.edu/hurricanes/repository) forecast aid projection system,
which is hosted by NCAR's [Research Applications Laboratory](https://ral.ucar.edu/)
(RAL), utilizes the DAT file type to store TC forecast tracks, intensity
information, and several other variables output by a variety of dynamical and
statistical models. These files can be cumbersome to use, as they often contain
large numbers of rows, varying numbers of columns per row, and lots of missing
or incomplete data, making them difficult to parse and query.
